# Portal RBAC

The portal decides what each user may do with an Argo CD-style policy. MongoDB
still authorizes every operation with the user's own credentials, so portal RBAC
can only **narrow** access. It can never grant more than the MongoDB user has.

## Policy format

```csv
p, <role>, <resource>, <action>, <object>[, allow|deny]
g, <subject>, <role>
```

* **Roles** are named `role:<name>`. A `g` line may also make one role inherit
  another (`g, role:team, role:editor`).
* **Subjects:**
  * OpenShift user or group names, as given (as in Argo CD);
  * `user:<name>` or `group:<name>`, to be explicit;
  * `mongodb:<user>@<authSource>` or `mongodb:<user>` for MongoDB-only sign-ins
    (when SSO is not used or not available).
* **Objects** are globs over `<db>` or `<db>/<collection>`: `*` matches any text
  (including `/`), `?` matches one character.
* A request is allowed when a rule of the user's roles allows it **and no rule
  denies it**.

| Resource | Actions | Object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `databases` | `get`, `delete` | `<db>` |
| `collections` | `get`, `create`, `update` (rename), `delete` | `<db>/<coll>` |
| `documents` | `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | `<db>/<coll>` |
| `indexes` | `get`, `create`, `delete` | `<db>/<coll>` |
| `shell` | `use`, `admin` (administrative `runCommand`s such as `currentOp`, `killOp`) | `*` / `<db>` |
| `server` | `get` | profile name |
| `audit` | `get` | `self` or `all` |

Creating a database means creating its first collection (`collections:create`).

## Built-in roles

| Role | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `role:readonly` | Browse and query everything; use the shell; see own audit events |
| `role:editor` | readonly, plus document changes, index changes and creating collections |
| `role:admin` | Everything, including dropping collections and databases and seeing all audit events |

Policies may add rules to the built-in roles or define their own.

## Default role

`policy.default` (or `rbac.defaultRole`) is granted to everyone who signs in.
The shipped default is `role:readonly`: every user still needs valid MongoDB
credentials, and MongoDB enforces their privileges. Set it to an empty value to
grant nothing unless the policy maps the user. Users with no role see an
explanatory "No portal access" page.

## Where the policy comes from

1. `rbac.policy` (inline in the configuration) and the deprecated
   `identity.developerGroups` / `sreGroups`, which become
   `g, <group>, role:readonly` / `role:admin`.
2. `rbac.policyDir` (default `/etc/mongo-portal/rbac`): `policy.csv` and
   `policy.default`, which are the keys of the `mongo-portal-rbac` ConfigMap
   ([`rbac-policy.yaml`](../../examples/openshift/mongo-portal/base/rbac-policy.yaml)).

The directory is re-read every `rbac.reloadInterval` (30 seconds). Changes apply
without restarting pods or ending sessions. An invalid edit is **rejected** and
the previous policy stays active. The error appears in the logs, on the System
status page and on My permissions. A missing ConfigMap is not an error; the
configuration policy applies.

## Examples

```csv
# Teams by OpenShift group
g, mongo-portal-sre-prod, role:admin
g, mongo-portal-developers-prod, role:readonly

# The payments team may change orders, but never delete the archive
p, role:payments, documents, *, shop/orders*, allow
p, role:payments, documents, delete, shop/orders_archive, deny
g, payments-team, role:payments

# Keep SREs productive while OpenShift is down (MongoDB-only sign-in)
g, mongodb:sre-alice@admin, role:admin

# Hide a sensitive database entirely from developers
p, role:readonly, databases, get, hr, deny
```

## Where it is enforced

* **Every API endpoint** checks the concrete object, for example
  `documents update app/orders` for a document replace.
* **Database and collection lists** only show objects with `get` permission.
* **Aggregations:** collections read through `$lookup`, `$graphLookup` and
  `$unionWith` (also nested and in `$facet`) need `documents get`. The target of
  `$out`/`$merge` needs `documents create`, `update` and `delete`, and
  `query.allowWriteStages` must be enabled.
* **The shell:** every mongosh operation maps to a resource and action on its
  namespace. Administrative `runCommand`s need `shell admin`.
* **The UI** offers an action only when both RBAC and the user's MongoDB
  privileges allow it. **My permissions** shows the user's roles and rules, and a
  live **Check access** tool that asks the server.

`GET /api/v1/permissions?resource=documents&action=update&object=app/orders`
returns the same decision the server uses.
